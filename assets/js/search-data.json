          "content": "The seeds of inferred.ai grew from discussions at AI and Data Science meetups in Brisbane amongst a group data science students who wished to do something for community groups who could benefit from data science and technology but did not have the means to engage professionals on a permanent basis. Recognising that the students would also gain in excercising their skills whilst exposing them to a wider variety of problems to solve. Considering this a win-win situation Inferred.ai was formed to provide a focus for these efforts. .",
